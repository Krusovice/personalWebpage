        <h3>Resume</h3>
        <p>
            I am a Civil Engineering graduate from DTU, specializing in Geotechnical Engineering, with a passion for integrating data science and programming into engineering solutions. Below I have listed a few work areas.

            Data science and automation through Python and SQL.
            Plaxis 2D and Plaxis 3D automation through python API.
            Foundation settlement application through machine learning.
            Lateral stress propagation with Boussinesq.
            Foundation subgrade response during ship design impacts for Storstrøm Bridge. Solution automated with Sofistik and Excel to generate automatic reports for each foundation.
            Automation in Autodesk Revit.

        <h3>Revit Modeller at Sweco (2012-2016)</h3>
            <p>Starting out with an internship at Grontmij (Sweco) in 2012. As Revit was not as widely used, the majority of my internship  I was in charge of implementing and applying Autodesk Revit in the ports, marine and geotechnical department. As my interest was more lying in calculations, I was also making retaining wall and steel designs during my internship.
            </p>
        <h3>Structural Engineer at Sweco (2016-2018)</h3>
            <p>After graduation, I designed ports structures and geotechnical structures for two years. Our team won three tender design ports in a row with Per Aarsleff (Rønne Havn, Ystad Havn and Skagen Havn). I designed quay walls and settlements for those. Furthermore during the time, I designed heavy duty areas in Frederikshavn and Lindø havn.
            </p>
        <h3>Geotechnical Engineer at Sweco (2018-2020)</h3>
            <p>As the port marine and geotechnical department in Sweco was split into a geotechnical department and a port & marine department, I was sorted into the geotechnical department.
