CHECK 1. Learning docker so I can use it (3-5 hours)
CHECK 1. Change database to postgres (1-3 hours)
CHECK 1a Make Django+Nginx+postgres run in Docker (3-10 hours)
CHECK 2. Merging databases (1-3 hours)


3. Create a backup function with Apache Airflow (2-5 hours)

2. Learning apache airflow (5-10 hours)
4. Setup ETL for stockprices on Docker (3-7 hours)
5. Showing stockprices using D3 (1-3 hours)

6. Finish foundation article and publish it on the blog (5-10 hours)

3. Learning kafka (I'm not really sure, haven't touched it yet, but for this simple task, I would guess 3-7 hours)
7. Setup livestream using Kafka on Docker (3-10 hours)
8. Plotting livestream using D3 (1-3 hours)

So a total time between 28 and 66 hours. My best guess would probably be 45 hours. What do you think about that?

Extra ideas
* Setup a stream for the raspberry pi's CPU and ram usage. The stream shouldn't be public, as we dont want to expose the knowledge that the host is on a pi.
* Consider if there is something else that can be streamed to the website frontpage.
* Add house prices and interest rates to the stock market graph. Updated daily.
