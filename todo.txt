CHECK 1. Learning docker so I can use it (3-5 hours)
CHECK 1. Change database to postgres (1-3 hours)
CHECK 1a Make Django+Nginx+postgres run in Docker (3-10 hours)

2. Learning apache airflow (5-10 hours)
3. Learning kafka (I'm not really sure, haven't touched it yet, but for this simple task, I would guess 3-7 hours)

2. Merging databases (1-3 hours)
3. Create a backup function with Apache Airflow (2-5 hours)
4. Setup ETL for stockprices on Docker (3-7 hours)
